# Food Delivery Projet ðŸ›µ

A certification project about predicting food delivery time. Includes data processing, data cleaning, EDA and machine learning model creation (using linear regression and random forest), creating a Streamlit app prototype. 

Tools:
- Python for data processing, data cleaning and data exploration
- Tableau for visualisation and creating actionable dashboards
- Dataiku and Python for predicting delivery times with a machine learning model

Context: a food delivery company with a large client portfolio is looking to optimise their business, particularly they are studying the delivery time and key factors influencing it. 

Business goals: 
- present current state of delivery business
- analyse key factors and trends impacting delivery times
- propose ways to minimise delivery time
- optimise delivery fleet dispatch

Business consclusions:
- Fleet availability should be adapted to weather, traffic conditions and specific events
- Orders can be rebalanced between age groups
- Scooters are the most efficient type of vehicle, they should replace some of the motorcycles
- Delivery should be optimised with strategic geo-targeting, dynamic pricing and targeted promotions
